# Figures

This application is part of Timba Game's technical interview test. <br/>

Figures take some parameter from a text file and depending on what the user wrote, it will show a figure with a color and animation.<br/>

To see how this code was made, please read the [Documentation](https://github.com/juamarCas/Figures/wiki/_new)

## Application execution
The .exe file is in _Figures/Figures/Figures.exe_ you just need to double click it. <br/>
To reload the application after you modify the config.txt press __Enter__

### Configuration
The config.txt is in _Figures/Figures/res/config.txt_ open it with a text editor to modify the parameters.

#### Parameters
This are all the par√°meters you can use to modify the config.txt: <br/>
The way the user have to specify a parameter is: <br/>
-Command Variable = value<br/>

|                 |            |      UpDown     |                 |                                 |

\* The velocity of the animation could vary depending of the GPU, in case is to fast reduce the value of rate to something like 0.1

##### Example
Example 1:<br/>
```
-Color red =  0.8
-Color green = 0.4
-Color blue = 0.3

-Characteristic figure = Triangle
-Characteristic rate = 2
-Characteristic size = 4
-Characteristic animation = Box

```

Example 2:<br/>
```
-Color red =  0.5
-Color green = 0.3
-Color blue = 0.1

-Characteristic figure = Circle
-Characteristic rate = 4
-Characteristic size = 6
-Characteristic animation = Circular

```
